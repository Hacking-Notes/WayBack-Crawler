# Wayback-Crawler

Welcome to Wayback Crawler - the ultimate tool for finding hidden gems in the depths of the internet!

Are you tired of manually crawling through subdomains in search of juicy URLs? Look no further, my friend. WayBack Crawler is here to save the day.

Not only does our tool find subdomains like your average subdomain finder, but it goes the extra mile by searching for all possible URLs that have been registered on the Wayback Machine. That's right, we're diving deep into the internet archives to bring you the good stuff.

But that's not all, folks. WayBack Crawler is also equipped to analyze each and every URL it finds for potentially vulnerable parameters. That means we're on the lookout for any sensitive information that may have been sent through GET requests - like tokens, cookies, or login info.

So why waste your time sifting through subdomains and URLs when WayBack Crawler can do it all for you? Sit back, relax, and let us do the heavy lifting. Your next big discovery awaits!
